<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, x, y, and z are undeclared.</p>
<p>They are automatically declared when first used.</p>

y = 6;
z = x + y;
/*When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers. */
