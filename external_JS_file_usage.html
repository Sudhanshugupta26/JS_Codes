<script src="hello.js"></script>    <!--External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

    JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
    
    To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag: 
        An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

With a full URL (a full web address)
With a file path (like /js/)
Without any path -->
